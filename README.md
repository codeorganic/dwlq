# dunnwithlovequilting.com

Static website for **Dunn With Love Quilting** — free-motion longarm quilting in Des Moines, WA.

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and deployed to GitHub Pages on the custom domain `dunnwithlovequilting.com`.

---

## Local development

The repo ships with a `site.sh` wrapper that covers the everyday commands:

```bash
./site.sh dev          # live-reload dev server at http://localhost:1313
./site.sh build        # production build to ./public
./site.sh preview      # build, then serve ./public on http://localhost:1314
./site.sh check        # clean build with warnings — run before pushing
./site.sh clean        # remove build artifacts
./site.sh invoice      # open the printable invoice template in your browser
./site.sh help         # full command list
```

Underneath, it's just Hugo — `hugo server` and `hugo --minify --gc` work fine too.

### Requirements

- Hugo **extended** ≥ 0.142 (`brew install hugo`)
- That's it — no Node, no Tailwind toolchain, no database.

## Placeholders to fill in before launch

Open `hugo.toml` and replace every `REPLACE_ME`:

| Param           | Where to get it                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `formspreeId`   | Sign up at <https://formspree.io>, create a form, copy the ID (after `/f/`)     |
| `lightwidgetId` | Create a widget at <https://lightwidget.com> pointed at the public IG account   |
| `instagramUrl`  | Public Instagram profile URL                                                    |
| `pinterestUrl`  | Public Pinterest profile URL (or remove the line if no Pinterest)               |

You can deploy with placeholders still in place; the form and gallery will show friendly "configure me" messages instead of breaking.

### Recommended once the form is live

In Formspree's dashboard, toggle on **reCAPTCHA**. Without it, the 50/month free quota can be burned through by spam in a few weeks.

---

## Editing content

Each page is a Markdown file under `content/`. Front matter sets the title, subtitle, and SEO description; the body is normal Markdown. Shortcodes drop in pre-built blocks:

- `{{< pricing >}}` — the pricing card grid (kept in one place via `partials/pricing-block.html`)
- `{{< contact-form >}}` — the Formspree form
- `{{< lightwidget >}}` — the Instagram gallery embed

You can edit these files directly on GitHub.com from your browser if you don't want to keep Hugo running locally — GitHub Actions will rebuild and redeploy on every commit to `main`.

---

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This repo is set up to deploy via GitHub Pages using a workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Every push to `main` rebuilds the site and publishes it.

### One-time setup

1. **Push this repo** to `https://github.com/codeorganic/<repo-name>`.

2. **GitHub → Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**.
   - Custom domain: **`dunnwithlovequilting.com`** → Save.
   - After the DNS check turns green (5 min – 1 hour), enable **Enforce HTTPS**.

3. **GoDaddy DNS** (`dunnwithlovequilting.com` → DNS):

   First, remove any existing parking A record on `@` and turn off Domain Forwarding (Domain Settings → Forwarding → trash). Forwarding overrides A records and is the #1 reason custom GitHub Pages domains fail on GoDaddy.

   Then add:

   | Type  | Name | Value                       | TTL    |
   | ----- | ---- | --------------------------- | ------ |
   | A     | @    | 185.199.108.153             | 1 hour |
   | A     | @    | 185.199.109.153             | 1 hour |
   | A     | @    | 185.199.110.153             | 1 hour |
   | A     | @    | 185.199.111.153             | 1 hour |
   | CNAME | www  | `codeorganic.github.io.`    | 1 hour |

   Optional IPv6 (improves reach):

   ```
   AAAA  @  2606:50c0:8000::153
   AAAA  @  2606:50c0:8001::153
   AAAA  @  2606:50c0:8002::153
   AAAA  @  2606:50c0:8003::153
   ```

4. **Verify** from a terminal:

   ```bash
   dig +short dunnwithlovequilting.com         # → the four 185.199.x.153 IPs
   dig +short www.dunnwithlovequilting.com     # → codeorganic.github.io
   curl -I https://dunnwithlovequilting.com    # → HTTP/2 200 from GitHub
   ```

### Where Formspree submissions land

In the Formspree dashboard, point the form's notification email at whatever inbox you want (a personal Gmail is fine). That address is private — it never appears on the website. Customers reach you only through the contact form.

## SEO checklist after going live

1. **Google Search Console** — add `dunnwithlovequilting.com` as a Domain property, verify with the DNS TXT record GoDaddy lets you add. Submit `https://dunnwithlovequilting.com/sitemap.xml`.
2. **Google Rich Results Test** — paste the homepage and confirm `LocalBusiness` parses with no errors: <https://search.google.com/test/rich-results>.
3. **Pinterest Rich Pin Validator** — paste the gallery URL and confirm the article-type Rich Pin renders: <https://developers.pinterest.com/tools/url-debugger/>.
4. **Lighthouse** — open Chrome DevTools → Lighthouse → run "Performance, Accessibility, SEO" on the live homepage. Target ≥ 90 Perf, ≥ 95 A11y, 100 SEO.

### Strongly recommended next step (not built in)

**Google Business Profile** at <https://www.google.com/business/>. Free, ~30 minutes to set up, drives more local-quilting traffic than the website itself does. Use the same business name, address (or service area), phone, and hours. Verification is by phone or postcard.

## Invoices

`tools/invoice-template.html` is a self-contained printable invoice. Open it in any browser, edit the customer name, dimensions, etc., and **Print → Save as PDF**. The totals recalculate live as you type.

It lives under `tools/` so Hugo doesn't publish it — it stays a private working file in the repo.

When you outgrow it (around 20+ invoices/month or when you want online payment links and customer history), [Wave](https://waveapps.com) is the natural next step — free forever for invoicing in the US.
